## Simple data types with a finite set of options

Declaring a simple data type is done as follows:

```haskell
data SimpleNum = One | Two | Many
```

The names of the type and the alternative values (separated by `|`) should all begin with a capital letter.

Attempting to print `One` results in an error:

```haskell
Prelude> One

<interactive>:24:1: error:
    * No instance for (Show SimpleNum) arising from a use of `print'
      There are instances for similar types:
        instance [safe] Show Ghci2.SimpleNum
          -- Defined at <interactive>:2:44
    * In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it
```

In order to alleviate this, we can state that `SimpleNum` derives `Show`, a type class.

```haskell
data SimpleNum = One | Two | Many derives Show
```

```haskell
Prelude> One
One
Prelude> Two
Two
Prelude> Many
Many
```

Any type must derive show if we want to print out its values. 

A function to convert to an integer to a `SimpleNum` value can be written as follows:

```haskell
Prelude> :set +m -- enable multiline mode
Prelude> let convert 1 = One
Prelude|     convert 2 = Two
Prelude|     convert _ = Many
Prelude|
Prelude> convert 14
Many
Prelude> map convert [1..5]
[One,Two,Many,Many,Many]
```

## More complex types with multiple values

A cricket score is made up of two integer values - the number of runs made and the number of players that were eliminated.

```haskell
data CricketScore = Score [Char] Int Int deriving Show
```

`Score` is a type constructor that allows us to create `CricketScore` values.

```haskell
Prelude> let x = Score "New Zealand" 350 4
Prelude> x
Score "New Zealand" 350 4
Prelude> :t x
x :: CricketScore
```

These are called *algebraic data types*.

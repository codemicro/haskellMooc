## Basic elements by example

In Haskell, you only ever have expressions. There are no statements.

### Functions

```py
def hello(name):
    return "hello " + name
```

```hs
hello name = "hello " ++ name
```

### Types

```c
int f (int x, int y) {
    return x*y+x+y;
}
```

```hs
f :: Int -> Int -> Int
f x y = x*y+x+y
```

### Lists

```py
lst = [1, 2] + [3, 4]
```

```hs
lst = [1, 2] ++ [3, 4]
```

### Anonymous functions

```js
let f = function(x, y) {
    return x*y+x+y;
};
```

Anonymous functions form the basis of the Haskell programming language (by the name of *lambda functions*).

```hs
f = \x y -> x*x+y*y
```

### Higher-order functions

Many other languages let you perform functions on functions. In other words, they take functions as arguments.

This Perl function doubles the elements in a list created in the range of one to ten.

```pl
map sub ($x) {$x*2+1}, [1..10]
```

Haskell both provides many of these *higher-order functions*, while also letting you define your own.

```hs
map (\x -> x*2+1) [1..10]
```

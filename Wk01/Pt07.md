### Blocks

Functions are typically blocks of code.

```js
function roots(a, b, c) { // find the roots of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula
    det2 = b*b-4*a*c;
    det  = sqrt(det2);
    rootp = (-b + det)/a/2;
    rootm = (-b - det)/a/2;
    return [rootm,rootp]
}
```

In Haskell, this function can (and is) written as an expression.

```hs
roots a b c =
    let
        det2 = b*b-4*a*c;
        det = sqrt(det2);
        rootp = (-b + det)/a/2;
        rootm = (-b - det)/a/2;
    in
        [rootm, rootp]
```

Because it's an expression, there is no need for an explicit return statement. It just sort of implicitly returns a value, a similar to lambdas in Python.

### Conditions

```py
def max(x, y):  # oh no, shadowing built-ins! aaaaaaaaaaaa
    if x > y:
        return x
    else:
        return y
```

```hs

max x y = 
    if x > y
        then x
        else y
-- or
max x y = if x > y then x else y
```

The same "this is an expression so no return statement" concept applies here.

### Case/switch statements

```ruby
Red = 1
Blue = 2
Yellow = 3

color = set_color();
action = case color 
    when Red then action1()
    when Blue then action2()
    when Yellow then action3()
end
```

```hs
data Colour = Red | Blue | Yellow

colour = set_colour -- this is not passing a reference to a function, this is a function call without arguments
action = case colour of
    Red -> action1
    Blue -> action2
    Yellow -> action3
```

This case is actually using a data *type* for case switching, whereas in other languages, enumeration would have to be used.

I think `data` in this case also might be similar to Go's `iota`.

### Generics/templates

In languages like Java and C++, there are generic "template" datatypes, such as 

```java
Map<String,Integer> set = new HashMap<String,Integer>();

set.put("Answer", 42)
```

This can also be done in Java, but without objects. Since `set` is an immutable variable, the return value of `Data.Map.insert` is bound to a new variable instead rather than updating the pre-existing one in place, like most other languages would do.

```hs
set :: Data.Map.Map String Integer
set = Data.Map.empty

set' = Data.Map.insert "Answer" 42 set
```

## Input/output

Because Haskell is a pure functional language... IO is not simple!

### Printing a string to the console

```hs
putStrLn "hello world" -- > "hello world"
putStrLn ("good " ++ "morning" ++ " everyone") -- > good morning everyone
```

### Getting input from the console

```hs
getLine -- > "hello world I typed this"
```

### Sequencing IO

Values are bound to variables using `<-` and not with an equals symbol (since it's an IO operation).

```hs
do { putStrLn "what is your name?"; x <- getLine; putStrLn ("hello " ++ x) }
-- > "what is your name?" < Abi "hello Abi"

do { putStrLn "what is your name?"; n<-getLine; let nUpper = map toUpper n in putStrLn ("HELLO " ++ nUpper) }
-- > "what is your name?" < Abi "HELLO ABI"
```

### Converting strings to numbers and vice versa

Input can be read from the console as a string and converted to an integer using the `read` function and type annotations.

```hs
read "42" :: Int -- > 42
read "42" :: Float -- > 42.0
```

Conversely, the `show` function can take numbers and convert them into string representations. Only types that derive show can be converted to strings.

```hs
show 42 -- > "42"
```

`show` also allows arbitrary values to be printed, since `putStrLn` requires a string argument.

```hs
putStrLn (show (6 * 7)) -- > "42"
```

The `print` function wraps these two.

```hs
print 42 -- > "42"
```

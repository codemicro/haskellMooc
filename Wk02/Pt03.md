# Wk02x03 - The `zip` operator

## Combining lists

The `zip` function can combine two lists into a single list of pairs of elements from each of the other two lists.

```hs
zip [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6] -- > [(1, 4),(2, 5),(3, 6)]
```

You can also `zip` two lists of different types, in this case a character list (a string) and an integer list.

```hs
zip [1, 2, 3] "abc" -- > [(1,'a'),(2,'b'),(3,'c')]
```

## More than two lists

`zip3` exists!

```hs
zip3 "glasgow" "beijing" "nairobi"
-- > [('g','b','n'),('l','e','a'),('a','i','i'),('s','j','r'),('g','i','o'),('o','n','b'),('w','g','i')]
```

However, they're all of the same length...

## `zip`ing lists of different lengths

The length of the output of `zip` is the shortest of all input lists.

```hs
length [1..10] -- > 10
length ['a'..'z'] -- > 26

zip [1..10] ['a'..'z']
-- > [(1,'a'),(2,'b'),(3,'c'),(4,'d'),(5,'e'),(6,'f'),(7,'g'),(8,'h'),(9,'i'),(10,'j')]
```

## `zipWith`

The `zipWith` function allows us to specify a function that is used to determine what element is inserted into the new list that is returned by the function.

```hs
zipWith max [1, 2, 3] [0, 2, 4] -- > [1,2,4]
zipWith (+) [1, 2, 3] [0, 2, 4] -- > [1,4,7] (note the infix operator)
```

## Replicating `zip` using `zipWith`

```hs
zipWith (\x y -> (x, y)) [1, 2, 3] [0, 2, 4] -- > [(1,0),(2,2),(3,4)]
```

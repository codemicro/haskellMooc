## Equality and comparison, list membership and infix and prefix operators

### Equality and comparison

```hs
42 == 42 -- > True
1 == 2 -- > False
1 /= 2 -- > True (this is Haskell's not equal)

"hello" == "hola" -- > False

10 > 9 -- > True

[1, 2, 3] < [1, 2, 3, 4] -- > True (based off the sum of the list)
[4, 5, 6] < [1, 2, 3, 4] -- > False

"Aardvark" < "Aaronic" -- > True (based off alphabetical order)
```

### List membership

List membership can be tested using the `elem` operator

```hs
elem 1 [1, 2, 3] -- > True
elem 5 [1, 2, 3] -- > False
```

### Infix and prefix operators

The `elem` operator can also be used as an infix operator when surrounded by backticks (the game goes for any prefix operator).

```hs
3 `elem` [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] -- > True
42 `max` 13 -- > 42
```

Traditionally infix operators (like `+`) can be used as prefix operators when surrounded by brackets.

```hs
(+) 1 2 -- > 3
```

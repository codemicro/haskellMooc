# Wk04x04 - `Maybe`

The `Maybe` type in Haskell is used to represent a value that may or may not be present.

## The definition of `Maybe`

The `Maybe` type derives `Eq` and `Ord` type classes, and has both `Nothing` and `Just`, only the latter of which can hold a value.

```haskell
data  Maybe a  =  Nothing | Just a
  deriving ( Eq  -- ^ @since 2.01
           , Ord -- ^ @since 2.01
           )
```

## Returning a `Maybe`

In this example, `Maybe` is used alongside the `Int` type to denote that we might get an integer back, but we also might not.

```haskell
maxhelper :: Int -> [Int] -> Int
maxhelper x [] = x
maxhelper x (y:ys) = maxhelper (if (y > x) then y else x) ys

maxfromlist :: [Int] -> Maybe Int
maxfromlist [] = Nothing
maxfromlist (x:xs) = Just (maxhelper x xs)
```

Using `Maybe` forces a caller to check the value of the return statement.

## Dealing with `Maybe`s

A `Maybe` type can't be dealt with in the same way as any other type. To use these `Maybe` types with other functions, the `fmap` high-level function can be used.

```haskell
Prelude> let inc x = x+1
Prelude> inc 1
2
Prelude> inc (Just 1)

<interactive>:21:1: error:
    * Non type-variable argument in the constraint: Num (Maybe a)
      (Use FlexibleContexts to permit this)
    * When checking the inferred type
        it :: forall a. (Num a, Num (Maybe a)) => Maybe a
Prelude> fmap inc (Just 1)
Just 2
Prelude> fmap inc Nothing
Nothing
```

# Wk04x03 - Guards

Guards can be used in a Haskell function in order to define a return value for a specific set of inputs.

## Side by side comparison

```haskell
absolute x = if (x < 0) then (-x) else x

absolute x
    | x < 0 = -x
    | otherwise = x
```

The `otherwise` section should also come last - it's the equivalent of the `default` in a switch statement, for example.

Both functions perform the same way and give identical outputs, except one is defined with guards and one is defined using a "traditional" `if-then-else` statement. A `guard` is superior when there are more than two conditions to test, since it's more readable.

```haskell
holeScore :: Int -> Int -> String
holeScore strokes par
    | score < 0 = show (abs score) ++ " under par"
    | score == 0 = "level par"
    | otherwise = show(score) ++ " over par"
    where score = strokes-par
```

## Case statements and pattern matching

Case expressions are like guards, but for types instead.

```haskell
data Pet = Cat | Dog | Fish

greeting :: Pet -> String
greeting x = 
    case x of
        Cat -> "meow"
        Dog -> "woof"
        Fish -> "bubble"
```

This can also be done with more complex types.

```haskell
data Pet = Cat | Dog | Fish | Parrot String

greeting :: Pet -> String
greeting x = 
  case x of
    Cat -> "meow"
    Dog -> "woof"
    Fish -> "bubble"
    Parrot name -> "pretty " ++ name
```

As with guards, we can also have a "catch-all" case, which is denoted by the `_` character.

```haskell
greeting :: Pet -> String
greeting x =
  case x of
    Parrot name -> "pretty " ++ name
    _ -> "grunt"
```

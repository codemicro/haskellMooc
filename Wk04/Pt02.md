# Wk04x02 - Keeping code tidy

## `let` clauses

Variables can be scoped in Haskell using the `let` clause.

```haskell
let x = 2
in x*x -- > 4

let x = 2
    y = 3
in x+y -- > 5
```

Notice that variables are lined up - this is required in Haskell, much like in Python; indentation is used for language parsing.

```haskell
journeycost :: Float -> Float -> Float
journeycost miles fuelcostperlitre = 
    let milespergallon = 35
        litrespergallon = 4.55
        gallons = miles/milespergallon
    in (gallons*litrespergallon*fuelcostperlitre)
```

Variables in a `let` can also reference other variables in the same block.

## `where` clauses

`where` can be used inside an expression.

```haskell
cel2fahr :: Float -> Float
cel2fahr x = (x*scalingfactor) + freezingpoint
    where scalingfactor = 9.0/5.0
        freezingpoint = 32
```

The `where` clause must be indented more than the start of the enclosing equation.

## The difference

A `let` clause can be used anywhere an equation can be used, however `where` clauses are not expressions. These clauses can only be used to provide some local variables for a top level equation.

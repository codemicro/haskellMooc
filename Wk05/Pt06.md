# Wk05x06 - Types, lambda functions and type classes

## Function types

* Ordinary data types are for primitive data or simple data structures
  * Eg. `Int`, `Char`, `[Int]`, `[Bool]`, etc
* Algebraic data types are types that combine other types either as a record or a variant
  * Record: `data Pair = Pair Int Double`
  * Variant: `data Bool = True | False`
* Functions have types containing `->`
  * Eg. `sum :: Int -> Int -> Int`

## λ expressions

A named expression looks a little like an assignment.

```haskell
sum = 2 + 2
```

However, you can also write anonymous, nameless expressions. 

```haskell
n = (-b) + sqrt (b^2 - 4*a*c)
```

If we didn't have anonymous expressions, we'd have to do something like this to get our final value.

```haskell
e1 = (-b)
e2 = b^2
e3 = 4*a
e4 = e3*c
e5 = e2-e3
e6 = sqrt e4
n = e1 + e6
```

Which is ridiculous.

### Anonymous functions

* A function can be defined and given a name with an equation. 
  * ```haskell
    f :: Int -> Int
    f x = x+1
    ```
* However, they can also be written without naming them using a lambda expression.
  * `\x -> x+1`
* In each case, `x` is declared as a formal paremeter and `x+1` is declared as the value for the expression.
* Lambda expressions can be used in place of any function, however they're most useful when used inside of larger expressions.
  * Eg `map (\x -> 2*x + 1) xs`

## Monomorphic and polymorphic functions

A monomorphic function means a function that "has one form". A polymorphic function means a function that has "many forms".

```haskell
-- monomorphic functions
f :: Int -> Char
f i = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" !! i

x :: Int
x = 3

f :: Char->String
f x = x:" There is a kind of character in thy life"

-- polymorphic functions
fst :: (a,b) -> a
fst (x,y) = x

snd :: (a,b) -> b
snd (x,y) = y

fst :: (a,b) -> a
fst (a,b) = a

snd :: (a,b) -> b
snd (a,b) = b
```

## Currying

Most programming languages have an unlimited number of parameters that you can specify in a function call. However, this is not required. You can restrict all functions to taking a single argument without losing expressiveness. In Haskell, this process is called currying.

### A function with two arguments

Take, for example, this function.

```haskell
f :: Int -> Int -> Int
f x y = 2*x + y
```

It, technically speaking, means the following:

```haskell
f :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
f 5 :: Int -> Int
```

Arguments are taken one at a time by the function. 

```haskell
f 3 4 = (f 3) 4

g :: Int -> Int
g = f 3
g 10 -- > (f 3) 10 -- > 2*3 + 10
```

This is why the `->` symbol is used in type definitions for Haskell functions. 

## Type classes and on-the-fly polymorphism

### The type of `(+)`

Take, for example, function `fst` with the type `fst :: (a, b) -> a`. There are no concrete types involved - this annotation just says that the function will return a value of type `a`, which is the same type of as the first value in the tuple.

Knowing this, what can we define the type of the `(+)` function to be?

```haskell
-- these are all valid, but limting
(+) :: Int -> Int -> Int
(+) :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
(+) :: Ratio Integer -> Ratio Integer -> Ratio Integer
(+) :: Double -> Double -> Double
-- Invalid - has to be a number, and these would allow things like lists and strings
(+) :: a -> a -> a
```

### Type classes

`(+)` can accept any type that's a member of the `Num` type class, and return a value of the same type as its inputs.

```haskell
-- Where a is a member of Num, take two as and return an a
(+) :: Num a => a -> a -> a
```

This means that `(+)` can accept things like `Int`, `Double`, etc. but not types like `Bool`, `[Char]`, `Int -> Double`, etc.

### The two types of polymorphism

#### Parametric polymorphism

Parametric polymorphism is where a polymorphic type can be instantiated to any tpe. This is represented by a type variable, convention dicating that they're letters of the alphabet (`a`, `b`, `c`...).

For example, `length :: [a] -> Int` can take the length of a list whose elements could have any type.

#### Ad-hoc polymorphism

Ad-hoc polymorphism is where a polymorphic type can be instantiated to any type that forms part of a type class. This is represented using the `=>` notation, for example `(+) :: Num => a -> a -> a`.

## Type inference

Type inference works on a set of type inference rules that link assumptions (what you're given) to consequences (what you can infer). These rules can be represented with fancy notation like this (which I suppose just looks like a fraction):

![inference rules](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Clarge%20%5Cfrac%7B%5Ctextup%7Bassumption%7D%7D%7B%5Ctextup%7Bconsequence%7D%7D)

Statements about types are written in this form:

![statements about types](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Clarge%20%5CGamma%20%5Cvdash%20e%20%3A%3A%20%5Calpha)

This means that if you are given a set of types, `Γ`, then it is proven that `e` has type `α`.

### The type of a constant

### The type of application

![type of application](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cbg_white%20%5Clarge%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CGamma%20%5Cvdash%20e_%7B1%7D%20%3A%3A%20%28%5Calpha%20%5Crightarrow%20%5Cbeta%29%20%5Ctextup%7B%20%7D%20%5CGamma%20%5Cvdash%20e_%7B2%7D%3A%3A%5Calpha%7D%7B%5CGamma%20%5Cvdash%20%28e_%7B1%7D%20%5Ctextup%7B%20%7De_%7B2%7D%29%20%3A%3A%20%5Cbeta%7D)

If `e1` is a function of type `α -> β`, the application of `e1` to an argument of type `α` gives a value of type `β`.

# Wk05x03 - Infinite data structures

Because of Haskell's lazy evaluation, we can do things like having infinite lists of values without causing one massive infinite loop in our program.

For example, we can declare an infinite list of consecutive integers as `[1..]`. A similar thing could be done with the `repeat` function - it will repeat a character forever.

```haskell
Prelude> x = [1..]
Prelude> head x
1
Prelude> take 3 x
[1,2,3]

Prelude> y = repeat 'a'
Prelude> head y
'a'
Prelude> take 3 y
"aaa"
```

## Fibonacci numbers

The nth Fibonacci number is the sum of the previous two. The beginning of the sequence looks something like this: `1 1 2 3 5 8 13`.

The entire Fibonacci sequence can be expressed in Haskell using this:

```haskell
Prelude> fibs = 1:1:(zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs))
Prelude> take 10 fibs
[1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
```

## Prime numbers

An infinite list of prime numbers can be found using this definition:

```haskell
Prelude> properfactors x = filter (\y -> (x `mod` y == 0)) [2..(x-1)] -- find values that have a remainder of zero when dividing value x
Prelude> primes = filter(\x -> (length (properfactors x) == 0)) [2..] -- filter an infinite list of number starting from 2 to get a list of primes
Prelude> take 10 primes
[2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29]
```

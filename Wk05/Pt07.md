# Wk5x07 - Partial application and currying

## Currying

Consider a function of type `f :: X -> Y -> Z -> A`. Because `->` is right-assoc., we can also write this definition as `f :: X -> (Y -> (Z -> A))`.

We can consider `f` as a function with a single argument that returns a function of type `Y -> (Z -> A)`, etc.

The technique of rewriting a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions, each with a single argument, is called currying.

```haskell
\x y z -> ...
\x -> (\y z -> ...)
\x -> (\y -> (\z -> ... ))
```

## Partial application

Partial application is enabled by currying. It allows us to provide only a small amount of arguments to a function. For example, it allows us to do things like this:

```haskell
sq x y = x*x + y*y

sq4 = sq 4 -- = \y -> 16 + y*y
sq4 3 -- = sq 4 3 = 25
```

In this statement, `doubles = map (*2) [1 .. ]`, the use of `(*2)` is use of partial application with the `*` operator.

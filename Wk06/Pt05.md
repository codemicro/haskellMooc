# Wk06x05 - Introduction to the Lambda calculus

Lambda calculus is fundamental to denotational semantics, the mathematical theory of what computer programs mean. Functional programming languages were developed with the explicit goal of turning lambda calculus into a programming language.

`ghc` works by:
 * removing all syntactic sugar (desugaring)
 * transforming the source into a version of lambda calculus called System F
 * using graph reduction to translate System F to machine code

# Wk06x10 - Monads

Monads allow the sequencing of function called by the function system, as opposed to lazy evaluation and unpredictable orders of evaluation. Examples of monads are the `Maybe` clause and the `IO` monad. They can be used (along with abstract data types) to allow actions (e.g. mutable variables) to be implemented safely.

## Parts of a monad

 1. A type constructor
   * Produces the type of a compuataion based on the result
 2. A function
   * Takes two computations
   * Performs them in sequence while making the result of the first available to the second

## Definition of a monad

* The type constructor, `M`
  * For any type `a`, `M a` is the type of computation in monad `M` that produces a value of type `a`
* A function, `return :: a -> M a`
  * If `x :: a`, then is `a` computation in `M` that, when executed, will produce a value of type `a`
* A function, `(>>=) :: M a -> (a -> M b) -> M b`
  * A chained series of functions that takes a value of type `M a`, applies that to another function which returns a type of `M b` that can then be executed
